## Quick Start

### Frontend (Flutter App)
```bash
cd flutter_app
API_PORT=8000
flutter run -d web-server \
  --web-port 8080 \
  --web-hostname localhost \
  --web-tls-cert-path certs/cert.pem \
  --web-tls-cert-key-path certs/key.pem
```

### Backend
```bash
cd src/backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-level debug
```

### Voice Services (Development)
```bash
cd src/backend
# Start voice agent worker
python voice_agent_worker.py

# Or use the convenience script
./start_voice_services.sh
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Set voice environment variables
export LIVEKIT_API_KEY="your-key"
export LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="your-secret"
export LIVEKIT_SERVER_URL="wss://your-server.livekit.cloud"
export CARTESIA_API_KEY="your-cartesia-key"
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your-deepgram-key"  # Optional

# Run bootstrap script
sudo ./bootstrap.sh
```

The app automatically deploys to [getspaced.app](https://getspaced.app) via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch.
