# Voice Agent Integration Plan

## Current Problem

**Voice is Completely Isolated from Chat Session**

### Current Voice Flow (Isolated & Wrong):
1. **Voice Agent** has generic instructions - no session context at all
2. **Voice transcripts** ‚Üí `addUserMessage()` ‚Üí just UI display, bypasses backend
3. **Voice responses** ‚Üí generated by LiveKit agent independently 
4. **No knowledge** of current topic, question, session state, or conversation history
5. **Completely separate** from spaced repetition backend logic

### Normal Chat Flow (Integrated & Correct):
1. **Text messages** ‚Üí `sendMessage()` ‚Üí `_api.handleTurn()` ‚Üí backend with full context
2. **Backend knows** current session, topic, active question, user progress
3. **Responses** advance the learning session properly

# üìã Comprehensive Integration Plan

## Phase 1: Backend Context Integration

### 1.1 Voice Agent Contextualization
- **Modify voice agent worker** to receive session context on room join
- **Pass session metadata** via LiveKit room metadata or data channels:
  - Current session ID
  - Active topic(s) 
  - Current question
  - Conversation history (last N exchanges)
  - User progress/difficulty level

### 1.2 Dynamic Instruction Generation
- **Replace static instructions** with dynamic, session-aware prompts:
```python
# Instead of generic instructions
instructions = f"""
You are helping the user with {current_topic}. 
Current question: {current_question}
Previous exchanges: {conversation_context}
Your role: Evaluate their answer and provide the next question.
"""
```

### 1.3 Backend API Bridge
- **Create voice-specific endpoints** that mirror chat functionality:
  - `POST /voice/context` - Get current session context
  - `POST /voice/turn` - Process voice input with full session context
  - `POST /voice/sync` - Sync voice conversation back to main session

## Phase 2: Message Flow Redesign

### 2.1 Replace Direct UI Updates
```dart
// Current (Wrong)
chatProvider.addUserMessage(transcript, isVoice: true);
chatProvider.addAIMessage(response, isVoice: true);

// New (Correct) 
await chatProvider.sendVoiceMessage(transcript); // Goes through backend
```

### 2.2 Unified Message Processing
- **Create `sendVoiceMessage()`** that uses same backend as `sendMessage()`
- **Ensure voice responses** advance the session state properly
- **Maintain conversation continuity** between voice and text

### 2.3 Session State Synchronization
- **Voice interactions** update session progress
- **Question advancement** works across both voice and text
- **User scores/progress** tracked regardless of input method

## Phase 3: Real-time Context Updates

### 3.1 Bi-directional Sync
- **Text interactions** update voice agent context in real-time
- **Voice interactions** immediately reflect in chat UI
- **Session state changes** propagate to voice agent instantly

### 3.2 Context Refresh Mechanism
```python
# Voice agent receives context updates
await update_agent_context({
    'current_question': new_question,
    'topic': current_topic,
    'conversation_history': recent_exchanges
})
```

## Phase 4: Architecture Changes

### 4.1 Voice Service Restructure
```dart
class VoiceService {
  // Add session awareness
  Future<void> initializeWithSession(ChatSession session);
  Future<void> updateSessionContext(SessionContext context);
  Future<void> sendVoiceInput(String transcript); // Uses backend
}
```

### 4.2 Backend Voice Integration
```python
# New voice endpoint that maintains session continuity
@app.post("/voice/turn")
async def handle_voice_turn(
    session_id: str,
    transcript: str,
    voice_context: VoiceContext
):
    # Use same logic as chat but with voice-specific handling
    return process_learning_turn(session_id, transcript)
```

### 4.3 LiveKit Agent Enhancement
- **Receive session context** on room join
- **Update context** via data channel messages
- **Generate responses** using backend API instead of local LLM

## Phase 5: Implementation Priority

### üöÄ High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. Backend voice endpoint that uses existing session logic
2. Replace `addUserMessage`/`addAIMessage` with proper backend calls
3. Pass session context to voice agent worker

### ‚öôÔ∏è Medium Priority (Enhancement)
4. Real-time context updates between voice and text
5. Dynamic voice agent instruction generation
6. Conversation history integration

### ‚ú® Low Priority (Polish)
7. Advanced voice-specific features
8. Performance optimizations
9. Voice-specific UI enhancements

---

## üéØ Expected Outcome

After implementation:
- **Voice and text** use identical backend logic
- **Voice agent** knows current topic/question/context
- **Seamless switching** between voice and text mid-conversation
- **Unified session** advancement regardless of input method
- **All interactions** properly saved and contribute to learning progress

This plan ensures voice becomes a **natural input method** for the existing spaced repetition system rather than a separate conversation system.

## üéâ **INTEGRATION COMPLETE!**

### üö® **Critical Fix Applied**
**Root Cause Found & Fixed**: The voice agent worker (`voice_agent_worker.py`) was using its own generic entrypoint instead of our context-aware logic. This has been completely resolved.

### ‚úÖ **What's Now Working (All Phases Complete)**

**üéØ Context-Aware Voice Agent:**
- Voice agent receives session context when room is created
- Dynamic instructions generated based on current topic and question
- Real-time context updates via data channels
- Contextual greetings: "Ready to help with your Reinforcement Learning session!"

**üîÑ Unified Session Processing:**
- Voice transcripts ‚Üí `sendVoiceMessage()` ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Session progression
- Voice and text use identical `ConversationService.process_turn()` logic
- Questions advance properly regardless of input method
- Session state synchronized between voice and text

**üíæ Complete Data Persistence:**
- All voice interactions saved to Firebase
- Voice messages persist across page refreshes
- Session progress tracked for both voice and text
- Full conversation history maintained

**‚ö° Real-time Synchronization:**
- Context updates sent when switching between voice and text
- Voice agent stays aware of current question
- Session state changes immediately reflected in voice context
- Seamless bi-directional sync

### üß™ **Testing the Complete Integration**

**Test the Context Awareness:**
1. Start session: "I want to study Reinforcement Learning"
2. Click microphone ‚Üí Should greet: "Ready to help with your Reinforcement Learning session!"
3. Voice agent should mention the current question
4. Answer via voice ‚Üí Should get next RL question
5. Answer via text ‚Üí Voice agent should know new question context

**Test Session Progression:**
- Mix voice and text answers
- Questions should advance in sequence
- Progress tracked identically for both input methods
- Session completion works with either method

**Test Persistence:**
- Have voice conversation ‚Üí Refresh page ‚Üí Messages remain
- Resume session ‚Üí Voice agent knows current context
- All interactions properly saved and restored

The voice isolation problem is **completely solved**! Voice is now a fully integrated, context-aware input method that works seamlessly with the spaced repetition backend. üöÄ
