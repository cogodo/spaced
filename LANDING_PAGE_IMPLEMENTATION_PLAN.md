## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 2.1: Landing Page Visual Enhancements** ðŸ”„ **UPCOMING**
**Goal:** Enhance the landing page with improved visual design and animations

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Make the logo match the text color it is next to (dynamic color theming)
- [ ] Set the default color theme to be the dark theme
- [ ] Update the visual on the landing page to be an animation of the logo (replace current hero visual)
- [ ] Add smooth fade-in/out transitions when scrolling the landing page (scroll-triggered animations)

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Logo colors dynamically match adjacent text colors
- [ ] Dark theme as default application theme
- [ ] Animated logo visual in hero section
- [ ] Smooth scroll-based fade transitions throughout landing page

**Technical Notes:**
- Logo color matching may require SVG logo assets or dynamic color filters
- Default theme change requires updating theme initialization in main.dart
- Logo animation will replace the current floating elements visual
- Scroll transitions will use Flutter's animation controllers with scroll listeners

## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Authentication Implementation** âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Goal:** Add Firebase authentication with email and Google OAuth

**Tasks:**
- âœ… Create authentication service layer
- âœ… Build login/signup screens with email and Google options
- âœ… Implement authentication state management
- âœ… Add "Login/Sign Up" button to landing page header
- âœ… Handle authentication errors and loading states
- âœ… Set up authentication flow routing

**Deliverables:**
- âœ… Working email/password authentication
- âœ… Google OAuth integration
- âœ… Smooth authentication flow from landing page

**Completion Summary:**
- **Authentication Service (`AuthService`)**: Comprehensive service with email/password and Google OAuth support, proper error handling, and user-friendly error messages
- **Authentication Provider (`AuthProvider`)**: State management using Provider pattern with loading states, error handling, and auth state listening
- **Login Screen (`LoginScreen`)**: Professional login form with email/password fields, Google sign-in button, form validation, and forgot password link
- **Sign-Up Screen (`SignUpScreen`)**: Registration form with email, password, confirm password fields, stronger password validation, and Google OAuth option
- **Forgot Password Screen (`ForgotPasswordScreen`)**: Password reset functionality with email sending and success confirmation
- **Reusable Widgets**: Created modular authentication widgets (`EmailFormField`, `PasswordFormField`, `GoogleSignInButton`, `AuthErrorMessage`)
- **Authentication Flow**: Integrated `AuthWrapper` in main.dart to handle authenticated vs unauthenticated routing automatically
- **Landing Page Integration**: Updated landing page to navigate to login screen instead of bypassing authentication
- **Logger Service**: Simple logging service for debugging and monitoring authentication operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive Firebase Auth exception handling with user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and disabled states during authentication operations
- **Form Validation**: Email format validation, password strength requirements, and confirm password matching
- **Responsive Design**: All authentication screens work properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts

**Notes for Implementation:**
- Authentication automatically redirects to main app when user signs in
- All authentication screens follow the same design language as the landing page
- Google OAuth ready but requires Google Services setup for production
- Password reset functionality sends emails via Firebase Auth
