      # 1. Install Flutter & enable caching
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: '3.32.0'            # Use stable channel
          cache: true                  # <-- turns on pub & pods caching

      # 2. Get packages (will be super-fast when cache hits)
      - run: flutter pub get
        working-directory: flutter_app

      # 3. Run your build/tests
      - run: flutter test
        working-directory: flutter_app
      - run: flutter build apk --release
