# Backend Environment Variables
#
# This file provides an example of the environment variables required to run the backend server.
# For local development, copy this file to .env and fill in the values.
# The .env file is ignored by git, so your secrets will not be committed.

# --- General Application Settings ---

# Set to "True" for local development to enable debug mode, which provides more detailed error messages
# and enables development-specific features (like permissive CORS).
# For production, this should be set to "False".
DEBUG=True

# The logging level for the application.
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
LOG_LEVEL=INFO


# --- Firebase Configuration ---

# The ID of your Firebase project. This should be consistent across your frontend and backend.
# Default is set for this project, but can be overridden.
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="spaced-b571d"

# The JSON credentials for your Firebase service account.
# This is REQUIRED for production deployments.
# For local development, the application will try to load `firebase_service_account.json` from the root of the backend directory.
# If using the Firebase emulators locally, this is not needed.
# Example: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type": "service_account", ...}'
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=

# (Local Development with Emulators ONLY)
# The host and port for the Firebase Authentication emulator.
# Uncomment this line and ensure it matches your `firebase.json` configuration when running emulators.
# FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST="localhost:9099"


# --- Service Dependencies ---

# The connection URL for your Redis instance.
# For local development, it defaults to a standard local Redis installation.
# For production (e.g., on Render), this will be provided by the hosting service.
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# Your API key for OpenAI.
# This is required for features that involve generating questions or processing conversational turns.
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"


# --- CORS Configuration ---

# A comma-separated list of allowed origins for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
# This is primarily for production. In development mode (DEBUG=True), a permissive
# list of local origins is used automatically.
# Example: CORS_ORIGINS="https://your-production-domain.com,https://your-staging-domain.com"
CORS_ORIGINS=""
